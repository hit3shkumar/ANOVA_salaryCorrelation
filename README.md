R ANOVA Report on the correlation of Profession, Region and Salary

Given a data set of a random sample of 121 individuals who are categorised in 3 groups by profession, and are also grouped with another factor (city of residence), 
The in depth analysis of what the profession is not given to us to prevent any implicit bias that may occur due to excess redundant information that does not change the outcome of our variance analysis.
But with the data we can set an objective we wish to see with the given data set, which is to analyse if there is any sufficient statistical evidence that shows a correlation between profession and the region one is situated in. 
The approach chosen to show model the data, is through the two factor ANOVA (analysis of variance of the given linear data, and 2 categories for each individual).
The dataset is called. "salary.csv" and we would use the values obtained in this dataset to come to a conlusion on whether there is a significant corellation between profession and region.
